## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [saphyr](https://crates.io/crates/saphyr), an actively maintained fork of yaml-rust.

Thanks to [Félix Saparelli](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1458) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> In addition to rewriting the tools in Rust, a safer language, some little-used features of sudo were not implemented in order to reduce vulnerability surface area. This turned out to be meaningful in July of 2025 when two vulnerabilities (..) were discovered in sudo features not implemented in sudo-rs. In response to one of those, sudo has deprecated and will remove the feature hosting the vulnerability.
