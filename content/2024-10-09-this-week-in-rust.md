## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A quiet week without too many perf. changes, although there was a nice perf. win on documentation
builds thanks to [#130857](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/. Overall the results were positive.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
Revision range: [4cadeda9..c87004a1](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=4cadeda932d5c261a9a0b1bbd25c4486e4e0a4c6&end=c87004a1f5be671e3f03f69fb13d8915bdbb6a52&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

# Quote of the Week

> Just to provide another perspective: if you can write the programs you want to write, then all is good. You don't have to use every single tool in the standard library.
>
> I co-authored the Rust book. I have twelve years experience writing Rust code, and just over thirty years of experience writing software. I have written a macro_rules macro exactly one time, and that was 95% taking someone else's macro and modifying it. I have written one proc macro. I have used Box::leak once. I have never used Arc::downgrade. I've used Cow a handful of times.
>
> Don't stress yourself out. You're doing fine.
