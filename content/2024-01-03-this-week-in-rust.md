### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Overall, this week had very few regressions and a moderate amount of improvements. The two biggest improvements came in how metadata was being encoded including a change to only store StableCrateId once in DefPathTable which yielded a 0.3% average improvement across 79 different benchmarks.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [1ab783112..67b6975](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=1ab783112ab4e4807304dbd249b39771246013ef&end=67b6975051b83ef2bd28f06e8467470d570aceb3&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [rustdoc: search for tuples and unit by type with ()](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/118194)

* [Add RFC to discuss RustConf 2024 Steering Committee](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3549)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
