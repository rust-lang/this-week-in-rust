## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [srgn](https://github.com/alexpovel/srgn), a mix of tr, sed, rip-grep and tree-sitter.

Thanks to [Alex Povel](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1294) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A bunch of noise this week which has been dropped from the report (but may be
present in the summary figures). As a result, the week is pretty busy in amount
of changes, but the net effect is nearly neutral to a slight regression for
most workloads.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [71ffdf7..41d97c8](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=71ffdf7ff7ac6df5f9f64de7e780b8345797e8a0&end=41d97c8a5dea2731b0e56fe97cd7cb79e21cff79&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 0 Improvements, 10 Mixed; 4 of them in rollups
51 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2024-03-05.md)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC: Make Cargo respect minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) when selecting dependencies](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3537)

# Quote of the Week

> My experience with C++ is that, as I’ve become more of an expert in the language, I’ve become more disillusioned with it. It’s incredibly hard to do things that you should be able to do in software. And, it’s a huge problem for me to constantly be helping other engineers debug the same bugs over and over. It’s always another use after free. I’ve probably debugged 300 of those. \[...\]
>
> In our experience using the Rust ecosystem for almost three years now, I don't think we found a bug in a single Rust crate that we've pulled off the shelf. We found a bug in one of them and that was a Rust crate wrapping a C library and the bug was in the C library. The software quality that you kind of get for free is amazing.
