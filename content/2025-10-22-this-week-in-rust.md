## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [extend\_mut](https://docs.rs/extend_mut), a library to safely extend the lifetime of an exclusive reference under some constraints.P

Thanks to [Oleksandr Babak](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1482) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

[Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing)
* [Tracking Issue for cargo-script RFC 3424](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12207)
  * [Testing Steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12207#issuecomment-3412997290)


* *No calls for testing were issued this week by
  [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
