### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Unfortunately a change introduced in [rust-lang/rust#89836](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89836) has made performance across different compiler artifacts much more variable by embedding compiler version information (including a git commit hash) in demangled symbol names. This means that even if two compiler artifacts are built from the same exact source code (with only the git commit changed), the compiler will have slightly different performance characteristics. This makes comparisons across pull requests virtually impossible. 

The compiler team is still deciding what to do to handle this, but in the mean time, performance testing is largely broken. This issue is currently being tracked in[rust-lang/rustc-perf#1126](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1126).

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Thread local Cell methods.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3184)

### Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now.
