### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A mixed week. I suppose it is best to focus on the fact we made some big
improvements to a large number of primary benchmarks, at the cost of some
smaller regressions to a smaller number of primary benchmarks.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [bb55bd44..edab34ab](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=bb55bd449e65e611da928560d948982d73e50027&end=edab34ab2abbafc16a78daedf71dbacd2eb0b7bf&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

|            | mean | max | count |
|:----------:|:----:|:---:|:-----:|
| Regressions ðŸ˜¿ <br /> (primary) | 0.6% | 1.6% | 35    |
| Regressions ðŸ˜¿ <br /> (secondary) | 2.1% | 8.1% | 23    |
| Improvements ðŸŽ‰ <br /> (primary) | -0.8% | -3.5% | 72    |
| Improvements ðŸŽ‰ <br /> (secondary) | -0.8% | -2.9% | 62    |
| All ðŸ˜¿ðŸŽ‰ (primary) | -0.4% | -3.5% | 107   |


4 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 4 of them in rollups
47 artifact comparisons made in total

Full report [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2022-06-14.md).

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC: Add a process_group method to UNIX CommandExt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3228)

### Final Comment Period

# Quote of the Week

> Because lower-level software has more operational constraints than higher-level software (e.g. it typically cannot tolerate a runtime or memory management via garbage collection), developing a memory safe language suitable for systems software is particularly challenging. The Rust language has met that challenge, however, and is an excellent candidate for replacing C in many systems applications.
>
> We plan to invest in the tools that allow systems engineers to move their software to Rust. This means investing in improving package management, compilers, and Foreign Function Interface (FFI) generators. In many cases this will include providing interfaces compatible with existing widely-used components to enable transition. With these tools, adoption of a memory safe alternative will scale much faster without replication of efforts.
