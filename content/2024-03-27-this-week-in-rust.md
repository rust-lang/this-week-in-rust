## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [coffee\_break](https://github.com/radekvit/coffee_break), the premier crate for those who think Rust compile times are too fast.

Thanks to [Jonas Fassbender](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1299) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Call for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

An overall fairly quiet week with the unfortunate one exception of large instruction count and binary size regressions caused by changes in const evaluation. This was largely balanced out (at least in instruction count) by a group of small improvements, but the compiler did end up 0.2% slower on average across 97 benchmarks.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [21d94a3..73476d](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=21d94a3d2c63cacf8eaf9d0ca770c0b450c558d4&end=73476d49904751f8d90ce904e16dfbc278083d2c&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range          | count |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (primary)    | 1.0%  | [0.2%, 3.2%]   | 56    |

# Quote of the Week

> "Top contributor" is not a place of glory, it *should* go to a bot because people should work at a sustainable pace and prioritize touching grass every once in a while. If a person ever works harder than bors, that's a problem!

– [Carol (Nichols || Goulding) on rust-internals](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/exclude-bots-from-contributors/20516/5)

Thanks to [Anton Fetisov](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/328/1552) for the suggestion!
