## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [derive\_more](https://docs.rs/derive_more), a crate for deriving a whole lot of traits

Thanks to [teor](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1306) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Call for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* [RFC: Make Cargo respect minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) when selecting dependencies](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3537)
  * [Testing steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/13873)

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* [CfT: Test out Rustup's `reqwest` backend with `rustls`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3806)
  * [Testing steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3806#issue-2278962476)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Largely uneventful week; the most notable shifts were considered false-alarms
that arose from changes related to cfg-checking (either cargo enabling it, or
adding cfg's like `rustfmt` to the "well-known cfgs list").

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [c65b2dc9..69f53f5e](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=c65b2dc935c27c0c8c3997c6e8d8894718a2cb1a&end=69f53f5e5583381267298ac182eb02c7f1b5c1cd&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 5 of them in rollups
54 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/6774c877ace0a2d9138b2b06ef0aabf6c2317a43/triage/2024-05-06.md)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Merge RFC 3325: Unsafe attributes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3325)
* [Merge RFC 3593: Reserve unprefixed guarded strings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3593)

# Quote of the Week

> Rust and its borrow checker are like proper form when lifting boxes. While you might have been lifting boxes "the natural way" for decades without a problem, and its an initial embuggerance to think and perform proper lifting form, it is learnable, efficient, and prevents some important problems.
>
> Or more succinctly:  
> C/C++: It'll screw your back(end).

And the reply:

> 1. there‚Äôs a largish group of men who would feel their masculinity attacked if you implied they should learn it
> 2. while it's learnable finding usefully targeted educational resources are hard to come by
> 3. proper form while lifting boxes are a really terrible way to model graphs
