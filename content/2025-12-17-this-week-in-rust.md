## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [logos](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/logos), a modern lexer generator.

Thanks to [Sam O'Brien](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1507) for the (partial self-)suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by
  [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This week we saw several regressions, partly from the compiler doing more work. The remaining
regressions are being investigated.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
Revision range: [55495234..21ff67df](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=554952348a7dd13851f25789f6bb1061f45c4b60&end=21ff67df15329dd7548ccba54b6c6ae9a562124f&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range          | count |
