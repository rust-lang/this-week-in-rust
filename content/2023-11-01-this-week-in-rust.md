## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [silkenweb](https://crates.io/crates/silkenweb), a library for building web apps with fine-grained reactivity and a clean separation of logic and UI.

Thanks to [henrik](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1255) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)

An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`

# Quote of the Week

> After doing a best fit, we found Rust projects were less likely to introduce vulnerabilities than their equivalent C++ projects at all relevant experience levels, but more importantly, we found the effect was most significant for first-time contributors, who were almost two orders of magnitude less likely to contribute vulnerabilities. That is, even though Rust may have a reputation as a harder language to learn, there is a very measurable effect that makes it better for newbies. Reviewers should not have to put as much effort into reviewing code to be confident that someone making their first foray into their project is accidentally adding a vulnerability.
