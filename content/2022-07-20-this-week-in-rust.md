### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A rather rough week for compiler performance with regressions outweighing improvements by a considerable margin, in particular in real world crates. To add insult to injury, the biggest regressions came in rollups which make it difficult to trace the cause.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [b3f4c311..8bd12e8](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=b3f4c3119957aa0a250cab08ab586b7a9a680ef1&end=8bd12e8cca3f28f302b9cc0f1f47bb64bd1f98fd&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

|            | mean | max | count |
|:----------:|:----:|:---:|:-----:|
| Regressions 😿 <br /> (primary) | 1.5% | 4.0% | 176   |
| Regressions 😿 <br /> (secondary) | 1.8% | 6.4% | 147   |
| Improvements 🎉 <br /> (primary) | N/A  | N/A | 0     |
| Improvements 🎉 <br /> (secondary) | -1.6% | -4.1% | 9     |
| All 😿🎉 (primary) | 1.5% | 4.0% | 176   |


7 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 4 of them in rollups
48 artifact comparisons made in total

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Rolling co-lead roles for T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commit/2c687cd9712ed4cfe24ac042c12f55b0c908be72)
* [Mention about removal of crate visibility specifier](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commit/e56963f86d252989bc8b3b55d3a454b9d93ede46)
* [Fixed the associated syntax error in the associated type Trait Headers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commit/45d66ff0c063f14371b49caa6dea5d62aa7c9d7e)

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

# Quote of the Week
