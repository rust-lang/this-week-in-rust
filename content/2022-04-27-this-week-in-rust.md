### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This was, in general, a positive week for compiler performance. There were many concentrated efforts on improving rustdoc performance with a lot of real world crates showing ~4-7% improvements in full build times. Additionally, there was further improvement to `macro_rules!` performance with many real world crates improving performance by as much as 18% in full builds! On the other hand, the regressions were mostly minor and largely relegated to secondary benchmarks.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [4ca19e0..1c988cf](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=4ca19e09d302a4cbde14f9cb1bc109179dc824cd&end=1c988cfa0b7f4d3bc5b1cb40dc5002f5adbfb9ad&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

4 Regressions, 6 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups
45 artifact comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> This is the most fundamental philosophy of both the Rust language and the Rust project: we don't think it's sufficient to build robust systems by only including people who don't make mistakes; we think it's better to provide tooling and process to catch and prevent mistakes.

â€“ [Jane Lusby on the inside Rust blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2022/04/19/imposter-syndrome.html)

Thanks to [farnbams](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/328/1220) for the suggestion!
