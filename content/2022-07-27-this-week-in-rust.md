### Rust Compiler Performance Triage


Overall it was a mostly good week, with some very significant wins among the
secondary benchmarks. Rollups continue to complicate triage process.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [8bd12e8c..50166d5e](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=8bd12e8cca3f28f302b9cc0f1f47bb64bd1f98fd&end=50166d5e5e82ca795306824decbe4ffabcc23d3d&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC: resolve crates.io source replacement ambiguity](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3289)

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for ptr_const_cast](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/92675)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)

* [new] [RFC: Improve C types for cross-language LLVM CFI support](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3296)

# Quote of the Week

> # JuSt Be CaReFuL
>
> If there’s one lesson from decades of software engineering, it is the failure of “just be careful” as a strategy. C/C++ programmers still experience memory corruption constantly, no matter how careful they are. Java programmers still frequently see NullPointerExceptions, no matter how careful they are. And so on. One of the reasons that Rust is so successful is that it adds automated checks to prevent many common mistakes.
