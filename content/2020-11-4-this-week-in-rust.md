# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [tract](https://github.com/sonos/tract) from Sonos, a neural network inference library, written purely in Rust for models in ONNX, NNEF and TF formats.

Thanks to [Benjamin Minixhofer](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/837) for the suggestion!

## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-11-03](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-11-03.md):
0 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 0 mixed

A number of improvements on various benchmarks. The most notable news this week
in compiler performance is the progress on instruction metric collection on a
per-query level; see [measureme#143](https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/pull/143) for the latest.

Otherwise, this week was an excellent one for performance (though mostly on
stress tests and auto-generated test cases rather than commonly seen code).

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-11-03.md) for more.

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:
