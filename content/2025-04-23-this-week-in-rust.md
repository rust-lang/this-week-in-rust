## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [Maycoon](https://maycoon-ui.github.io/), an experimental vello/wGPU-based UI framework.

Thanks to [DraftedDev](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1431) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Mostly positive week. Most of the improvements come from a revert of a regression from a few weeks ago, but we also get nice wins from re-using Sized  fast-path, coming from Sized hierarchy implementation work.

Triage done by **@panstromek**.
Revision range: [15f58c46..8f2819b0](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=15f58c46da79399961a09db0c650a2f90f442e6b&end=8f2819b0e3428d0aee05fa60e91e0211c2aea053&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
