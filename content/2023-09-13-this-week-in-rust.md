### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

An interesting week. We saw a massive improvement to instruction-counts across
over a hundred benchmarks, thanks to #110050 an improved encoding scheme for the
dependency graphs that underlie incremental-compilation. However, these
instruction-count improvements did not translate to direct cycle time
improvements. We also saw an improvement to our artifact sizes due to #115306.
Beyond that, we had a scattering of small regressions to instruction-counts that
were justified because they were associated with bug fixes.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [15e52b05..7e0261e7](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=15e52b05ca8f63e0da27c808680388717e5b997e&end=7e0261e7ea2085bdc0bc3d0fd6776bf343473858&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
84 artifact comparisons made in total

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Allow cfg-attributes in where clauses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3399)

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* [disposition: merge] [Cargo Check T-lang Policy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3477)
* [disposition: merge] [[RFC2603] Extend `<const>` to include `str` and structural constants.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3161)

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [Raise minimum supported Apple OS versions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104385)
* [disposition: merge] [Stabilize const_transmute_copy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/115520)

* [disposition: merge] [Accept additional user-defined syntax classes in fenced code blocks](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/110800)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [new] [Unify crate categories and keywords as tags](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3488)
* [new] [RFC: Cargo feature visibility (private/public)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3487)
* [new] [RFC: Cargo feature deprecation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3486)
* [new] [RFC: Cargo feature descriptions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3485)
* [new] [Unsafe Extern Blocks](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3484)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> It's very much a positive feedback loop: good tooling makes good tooling easier to build, so more of it gets built and the cycle repeats.
> `cargo-semver-checks` stands on the shoulders of giants like `rustc` and `rustdoc` and [Trustfall](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall). Remove any one of them (or even just `rustc`'s high-quality diagnostics!) and `cargo-semver-checks` wouldn't have been a viable project at all.
