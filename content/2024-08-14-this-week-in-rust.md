## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [rencfs](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs), a FUSE-based encrypted filesystem for Linux.

Thanks to [Radu Marias](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1329) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* [RFC: Make Cargo respect minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) when selecting dependencies](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3537)
  - [Testing Steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/13873)

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A big week for compiler performance brought on mostly by statically linking the std library into `rustc_driver` instead of dynamic linking. This overshadows all other improvements and regressions that were seen this week.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [8c7e0e16..9cb1998e](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=8c7e0e160831866bc1a40691a39455aac21271c0&end=9cb1998ea15e179482504e07cad8fa121e169a32&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

# Quote of the Week

> We are living through Rust finding its more "complete" form while still being an actually useful production language.

– [Catherine West on /r/rust](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1eq357a/ive_been_working_with_rust_for_a_couple_years_now/lhu5ag2/)

Given a woeful lack of suggestions, llogiq is reasonably pleased with his choice.
