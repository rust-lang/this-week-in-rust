### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Performance overall improved in the last week, but some of this is due to fixing
regressions from prior weeks. This week also brings an average of 4% improvement
in memory usage across all profiles due to
[#95171](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95171) bumping the LLVM/clang
used on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu to compile C and C++ code linked into rustc.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [1c988cfa..468492](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=1c988cfa0b7f4d3bc5b1cb40dc5002f5adbfb9ad&end=468492c2af3993f18b1fe98052200575c4a2e678&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
