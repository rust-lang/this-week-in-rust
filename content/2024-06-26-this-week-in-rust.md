## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall), a cargo subcommand to install crates from binaries out of their github releases.

Thanks to [Jiahao XU](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1317) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Mostly a number of improvements driven by [MIR inliner improvements], with a small number
benchmarks having a significant regression due to improvements in
[sort algorithms], which are runtime improvements at the cost of usually slight or
neutral compile time regressions, with outliers in a few cases.

[MIR inliner improvements]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/126578
[sort algorithms]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/124032
