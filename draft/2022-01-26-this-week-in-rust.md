### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A quiet week for regular rustc performance; incremental builds
(particularly ones with little recompilation to do) saw an average 1.5%
improvement. rustdoc also saw several notable optimizations land which improve
performance, particularly on larger benchmarks.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [72e74d..7bc7be](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=72e74d7b9cf1a7901650227e74650f1fcc797600&end=7bc7be860f99f4a40d45b0f74e2d01b02e072357&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
30 comparisons made in total
