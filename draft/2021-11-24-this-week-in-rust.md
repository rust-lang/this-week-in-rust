### Rust Compiler Performance Triage


This week, there were a number of cases where the `incr-unchanged` variants of `inflate` went up or down by 5% to 6%; we believe these are instances of increased noise in benchmarks documented on [rustc-perf#1105](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1105). I was tempted to remove these from the report, but its non-trivial to re-construct the report "as if" some benchmark were omitted.

Otherwise, there were some nice wins for performance. For example, PR [#90996](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90996) more than halved the time to document builds of `diesel` by revising how we hash `ObligationCauseData`. If anyone is interested, it might be good to follow-up on the effects of PR [#90352](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90352), "Simplify `for` loop desugar", where we have hypothesized that the increased compilation time is due to more LLVM optimizations being applied.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [934624fe..22c2d9dd](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=934624fe5f66ce3fb8abf0597a6deb079783335f&end=22c2d9ddbf356bcdb718e88ca6ee3665e1e42690&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

1 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 8 Mixed; 3 of them in rollups
34 comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> On the topic of reframing UB, I was reminded of an article about the [mechanics of oaths and vows in historical cultures](https://acoup.blog/2019/06/28/collections-oaths-how-do-they-work/).
>
> When a programmer writes `get_unchecked` , we can imagine them wanting to promise the compiler that they uphold its preconditions. But since the compiler is normally not so trusting of unproven assertions, the programmer swears an *oath* that their argument is in bounds.
>
> The compiler, seeing such a solemn commitment, treats the programmer's word as true and optimizes accordingly. The compiler is so thoroughly convinced that it never even entertains the possibility of doubting the programmer's oath.
>
> But if the programmer has sworn falsely, then they might well suffer divine retribution in the form of nasal demons — or worse, subtly baffling program behaviour.
