### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This week's report started with 6 regressions; after eliminating truly obvious noise, we are left with just 2 minor regressions. Of the cases that regressed, I think the only interesting one is keccak (regressed by 1.73% in PR #91549). But don't be too depressed: keccak was also improved up to 23% by PR #85013 (!); thanks to @**simulacrum** for that PR.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [e2116a..404c847](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=e2116acae59654bfab2a9729a024f3e2fd6d4b02&end=404c8471aba60c2d837fa728e7c729a0f52d5830&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups
48 comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> This is safer than you may think, because those who need async tend to know it themselves and
> don't ask "should I use async" question. In other words, asking itself is a signal that answer is
> no. MITM proxy case was a rare exception.
