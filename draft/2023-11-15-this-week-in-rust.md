### Research

### Miscellaneous

## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [cargo-msrv](https://github.com/foresterre/cargo-msrv), a cargo subcommand to find out the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of your crate.

llogiq is a bit worried about not having received suggestions for two weeks in a row, but still offers you his choice.

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A week dominated by one particular perf improvement that lead to huge performance gains - an avg of 5% improvement across 121 test cases! The perf improvement comes from adding an `#[inline]` hint to the output from `#[derive(Debug)]` which presumably allows the compiler to more easily do deadcode elimination reducing the binary size and the amount of code that actually needs to be code-gened.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [7b97a5ca..173b6e68](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=7b97a5ca8422d1495a8918106d3249aa405812d4&end=173b6e686b158dbad7d072c64bef3ced2052312b&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* [disposition: merge] [RFC: Superseding public/private dependencies](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3516)

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for mutex_unpoison](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/96469)
* [disposition: merge] [Tracking issue for dyn upcasting coercion](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65991)
* [disposition: merge] [rustdoc-search: add support for traits and associated types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116085)

#### [Language Reference](https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* *No Language Reference RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Unsafe Code Guidelines](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* *No Unsafe Code Guidelines entered Final Comment Period this week.*

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [new] [Add named path bases to cargo (v2)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3529)
* [new] [RFC: Associated const underscore](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3527)
* [new] [Add forbidden function casts RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3526)

* [new] [Create 0000-cargo-dns.md](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3523)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> I decided to keep learning Rust because I liked the syntax. I liked the speed. I liked the community. I liked it all. It felt like a breath of fresh air: a syntax more intuitive than Python, JavaScript, or C, yet still faster.

– [Goren Barak on their blog](https://digital-goobers.vercel.app/posts/learning-rust)
