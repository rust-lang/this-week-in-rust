### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A pretty busy week for performance, with quite a few PRs landing with
significant improvements to specific benchmarks. Overall the week was positive,
with many benchmarks improving at least a little. No significant changes in
memory usage this week.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [edab34a..abace0a](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=edab34ab2abbafc16a78daedf71dbacd2eb0b7bf&end=abace0a1f17986d89aedf610819deab2b4afee56&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

5 Regressions, 6 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups
54 artifact comparisons made in total

See [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2022-06-21.md) for details.

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Mention de-approval of `cfg(target = "...")`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3276)

### Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)
