## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [wtransport](https://crates.io/crates/wtransport), an implementation of the WebTransport specification, a successor to WebSockets with many additional features.

Thanks to [Josh Triplett](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1369) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A week dominated by one large improvement and one large regression where luckily the improvement had a larger impact. The regression seems to have been caused by a newly introduced lint that might have performance issues. The improvement was in building rustc with protected visibility which reduces the number of dynamic relocations needed leading to some nice performance gains. Across a large swath of the perf suit, the compiler is on average 1% faster after this week compared to last week.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [c8a8c820..27e38f8f](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=c8a8c82035439cb2404b8f24ca0bc18209d534ca&end=27e38f8fc7efc57b75e9a763d7a0ee44822cd5f7&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
