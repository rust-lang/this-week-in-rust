## Calls for Testing
An important step for feature implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your feature to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

<!-- If there are new CfT items this week, use: -->
<!--
  [Repo Name](Repo URL)
    * [<Feature name>](<Feature URL>)
        * [Testing steps](<Testing Steps URL>)
-->
<!-- where `Repo Name` and `Repo URL` are one of:
[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
[Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
[Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
[Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
-->

<!-- For all `Repo Names` with no new CfT items this week: use (removing the repos for which new
     CfT items did appear, of course) -->
<!--
* *No calls for testing were issued this week by
  [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Lot of regressions this week, mostly in rustdoc benchmarks from newly added features. The rest of the suite saw mostly small regressions in small benchmarks and also some improvements, notably from token tree parsing optimization in macro code, span optimization and ongoing work on new solver, which is not fully enabled, yet.

Triage done by **@panstromek**.
Revision range: [239e8b1b..ee361e8f](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=239e8b1b47b34120287ec36b33228c1e177f0c38&end=ee361e8fca1c30e13e7a31cc82b64c045339d3a8&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range          | count |

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

<!-- Approved RFCs go here, use this format: * [Topic](URL) -->
<!-- or if none were approved this week, use: * *No RFCs were approved this week.* -->
<!-- * []() -->

<!--
### [Approved Major Change Proposals (MCP)](https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/mcp.html)
<!~~ MCPs occur infrequently, so this section is commented out by default. ~~>
<!~~ MCPs which have been approved or rejected this week go here, use this format: * [major change accepted|rejected] [Topic](URL) ~~>
-->

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

# Quote of the Week

> I `clone()` everything now. The Borrow Checker permits this small rebellion, this inefficiency. It knows I suffer more knowing my code is not idiomatic. Every `.clone()` is a confession of my failure. Every `Arc<Mutex>` a monument to my inadequacy.
