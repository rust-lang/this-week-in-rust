### Research

### Miscellaneous

## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [ansic](https://crates.io/crates/ansic), a proc macro providing a DSL to output ANSI escape strings with zero runtime overhead.

Thanks to [Zeon](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1448) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing

An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

<!-- Calls for Testing go here, use this format:
    * [<RFC Topic>](<RFC URL>)
        * [Tracking Issue](<Tracking Issue URL>)
        * [Testing steps](<Testing Steps URL>)
-->
<!-- or if there are no new or updated RFCs this week, use: -->
<!-- * *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.* -->
<!-- Remember to remove the `call-for-testing` label from the RFC so that the maintainer can signal for testers again, if desired. -->

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

# Quote of the Week

> I love Rust, so I was already biased to be positive about the Rust for Linux project, even before dabbling with it myself. I'm genuinely surprised to be even more optimistic now than before. The coding part was much easier than I imagined, thanks to the use of reference counting in the kernel.
>
> And the promised benefits of Rust over C? They're absolutely real. The Rust version of the driver feels way more robust than the C code, not just regarding memory safety. It didn't have a single bug: Once it compiled, it worked. That's not a huge deal considering it was a direct rewrite, but it counts for something.

Despite a lamentable lack of suggestions, llogiq is reasonably pleased with his choice.
