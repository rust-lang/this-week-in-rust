### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Improvements generally outweighed regressions with most regressions coming in the form of correctness fixes (where performance regressions are generally less of a concern). The biggest win was arguably a change to the Sip128 hasher implementation which seemed to have decent performance implications for many real world crates. 

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [2b681ac..72e74d7](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=2b681ac06b1a6b7ea39525e59363ffee0d1a68e5&end=72e74d7b9cf1a7901650227e74650f1fcc797600&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 7 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 4 of them in rollups
28 comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> Language stability is not just about semver compatibility. It's also about not burdening developers to have to make new decisions when looking at old code. \[Language instability\] creates churn and debate about things that previously didn't require it.
