## Crate of the Week

<!-- COTW goes here -->

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer
and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a `call-for-testing` label to your RFC along
with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

Let us know if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

### CFP - Projects

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This week we had to merge a lot of large rollups due to many problems with our CI infrastructure,
which made analysis harder. Even though the aggregated stats look like there were a lot of regressions,
it is skewed by two large regressions happening on an uncommon optimized incremental build and a
documentation build of a single crate. The documentation regression is being tracked, and fixes to
some other regressions are already in progress.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
Revision range: [daf59857..9fb94b32](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=daf59857d6d2b87af4b846316bf1561a6083ed51&end=9fb94b32df38073bf63d009df77ed10cb1c989d0&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range           | count |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:---------------:|:-----:|

| All ‚ùå‚úÖ (primary)                 | 0.8%  | [-14.0%, 58.8%] | 180   |

2 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 4 of them in rollups
37 artifact comparisons made in total

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC: Deprecate the per-build-target `edition` field in `Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3772)
