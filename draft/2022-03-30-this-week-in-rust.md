### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Very quiet week for performance, with just one statistically significant change
landing in the last week. This change was a regression, though primarily in
stress tests, and was a result of a soundness fix.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [3ba1ebea..3ea4493](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=3ba1ebea122238d1a5c613deb1bf60ce24bd8fd8&end=3ea44938e21f0de8ae7d4f6399a8a30f97867c70&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

1 Regressions, 0 Improvements, 0 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups
37 comparisons made in total
