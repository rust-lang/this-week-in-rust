## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [ralertsinua](https://github.com/voiceapiai/ralertsinua), a text user interface for getting information about Russian air raids in Ukraine.

Thanks to [Vladyslav Batyrenko](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1311) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Call for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Fairly quiet week with the exception of a very large improvement coming from the switch to `rust-lld` on nightly Linux. This can have very large impacts on benchmarks where linking dominates the build time (e.g., `ripgrep`, `exa`, small binaries like `hello-world`). Aside from that change, there were a few small regressions that were either deemed worth it or are still being investigated.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [9105c57b..1d0e4afd](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=9105c57b7f6623310e33f3ee7e48a3114e5190a7&end=1d0e4afd4cac09078e12a232508c3e9f8d42535d&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

# Quote of the Week

> In other words, I do not want the compiler to just insert code to uphold the bare minimum guarantees, I want the compiler to check my work for me and assist me in developing an algorithm I can confidently assert is right.
