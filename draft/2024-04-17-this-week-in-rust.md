Want to get involved? [We love contributions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*This Week in Rust* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust) and archives can be viewed at [this-week-in-rust.org](https://this-week-in-rust.org/).

## Crate of the Week

<!-- COTW goes here -->

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

<!-- Calls for Testing go here, use this format:
    * [<RFC Topic>](<RFC URL>)
        * [Tracking Issue](<Tracking Issue URL>)
        * [Testing steps](<Testing Steps URL>)
-->
<!-- or if there are no new or updated RFCs this week, use: * *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.* -->
<!-- Remember to remove the `call-for-testing` label from the RFC so that the maintainer can signal for testers again, if desired. -->

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

### CFP - Projects

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

<!-- Approved RFCs go here, use this format: * [Topic](URL) -->
<!-- or if none were approved this week, use: * *No RFCs were approved this week.* -->
<!-- * []() -->

<!--
### [Approved Major Change Proposals (MCP)](https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/mcp.html)
<!~~ MCPs occur infrequently, so this section is commented out by default. ~~>
<!~~ MCPs which have been approved or rejected this week go here, use this format: * [major change accepted|rejected] [Topic](URL) ~~>
-->
