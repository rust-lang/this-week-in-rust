### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Add f16 and f128 float types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3453)
* [Unicode and escape codes in literals](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3349)

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [Consider alias bounds when computing liveness in NLL (but this time sound hopefully)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116733)
* [disposition: close] [regression: parameter type may not live long enough](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/117055)
* [disposition: merge] [Remove support for compiler plugins.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116412)
* [disposition: merge] [rustdoc: Document lack of object safety on affected traits](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113241)
* [disposition: merge] [Stabilize Ratified RISC-V Target Features](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116485)
* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for const mem::discriminant](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69821)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [new] [eRFC: #[should_move] attribute for per-function opting out of Copy semantics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3518)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
