### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Our build pipeline got sped up by PR #112012, which side-steps one of the rustc
rebuilds we were suffering with before. (There is further potential speed-up by
caching LLVM, as noted by on that PR.) Other than that, various small
regressions that are largely noise, as well as one unexpected increase in binary
sizes from PR #109005 that we should follow up on.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [adc719d7..4bd4e2ea](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=adc719d7147d5e2578ce08e0b4504be44650256e&end=4bd4e2ea824f4f458cae8917047ebb6b88853fe6&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

7 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 5 of them in rollups
46 artifact comparisons made in total

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Return position impl Trait in traits](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3425)

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

* [disposition: merge] [Implement Sync for mpsc::Sender](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111087)
* [disposition: merge] [resolve: Remove artificial import ambiguity errors](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112086)
* [disposition: merge] [Relax implicit `T: Sized` bounds on `BufReader<T>`, `BufWriter<T>` and `LineWriter<T>`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111074)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [new] [Infered types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3444)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
