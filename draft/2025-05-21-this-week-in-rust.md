## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [makepad](https://makepad.nl), an in development shader based live designable OSS UI-Framework.

Thanks to [crazust](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1435) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A relatively quiet week, likely caused by not that many PRs being merged as many contributors
were at RustWeek and the All Hands event. There were several nice wins in trait solving;
the benchmark suite now contains benchmarks that use the new trait solver, so we can now
focus on optimizing its performance in the near future.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.

Revision range: [718ddf66..59372f2c](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=718ddf660e6a1802c39b4962cf7eaa4db57025ef&end=59372f2c81ba74554d9a71b12a4ed7f29adb33a2&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

# Quote of the Week

> `/proc/self/mem` is outside the scope of rust's safety guarantees. otherwise this would open a can of worms that could not be closed except by forbidding debuggers from poking memory or marking every impure function as unsafe.
>
> like, what if you invoke gdb to poke memory? what if you modify .bash_profile to poke memory? what if you send an http request to a hypervisor to poke memory? what if you run a spin loop, and the noise of the fans whirring up activates a beam of ionizing radiation pointed directly at the CPU? what if opening the disk drive makes the computer fall off a cliff?
