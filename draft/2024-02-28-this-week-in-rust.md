## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [web-audio-api-rs](https://github.com/orottier/web-audio-api-rs), a Rust implementation of the Web Audio API for use *outside* the browser.

Thanks to [Otto Rottier](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1292) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A rare week where regressions out powered improvements to make the compiler roughly half a percent slower on average on nearly 100 benchmarks. Some regressions have fixes in the pipeline, but some remain elusive or were introduced to address correctness issues.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [5af21304..71ffdf7f](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=5af2130440c198afefbe5b8099342057cf272ef4&end=71ffdf7ff7ac6df5f9f64de7e780b8345797e8a0&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range          | count |
