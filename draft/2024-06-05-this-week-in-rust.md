## Crate of the Week

<!-- COTW goes here -->

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

### CFP - Projects

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage


A quiet week; we did have one quite serious regression (#115105, "enable
DestinationPropagation by default"), but it was shortly reverted (#125794).
The only other PR identified as potentially problematic was rollup
[PR #125824](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/125824), but even
that is relatively limited in its effect.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [a59072ec..1d52972d](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=a59072ec4fb6824213df5e9de8cae4812fd4fe97&end=1d52972dd8592edf4026aa577c8ce69acc0ac2d1&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 6 Mixed; 4 of them in rollups
57 artifact comparisons made in total


[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/fba75cc08937425ab274959581401b862a0b3068/triage/2024-06-03.md)
