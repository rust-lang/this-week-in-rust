## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [vidyut](https://github.com/ambuda-org/vidyut), a Sanskrit toolkit containing functionality about meter, segmentation, inflections, etc.

Thanks to [Arun Prasad](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1387) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* [Tracking issue for RFC 3695: Allow boolean literals as cfg predicates](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/131204)
  - [Testing steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/131204#issuecomment-2569314526)

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A quiet week with little change to the actual compiler performance. The biggest compiler regression was quickly recognized and reverted. 

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [0f1e965f..1ab85fbd](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=0f1e965fec3bc2f97b932e9dd8e85fca6d7faadc&end=1ab85fbd7474e8ce84d5283548f21472860de3e2&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean   | range           | count |
