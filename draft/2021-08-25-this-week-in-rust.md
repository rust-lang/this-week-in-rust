Category: This Week in Rust

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
This is a weekly summary of its progress and community.
Want something mentioned? Tweet us at [@ThisWeekInRust](https://twitter.com/ThisWeekInRust) or [send us a pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust).
Want to get involved? [We love contributions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*This Week in Rust* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust).
If you find any errors in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/pulls).

In the case of this newsletter, 404 is indeed found!

## Updates from Rust Community
[Enzyme](https://enzyme.mit.edu) is now available for Rust! Enzyme is a SOTA Auto-diff tool which works on arbitray (Rust) types.
It supports BLAS, GPUs, OpenMP and MPI (rayon next!). Usage might still be a little rough, but it should definetly work!
More details are available at this blog post in the rust-ml Group [here](TODO).

### Project/Tooling Updates

### Observations/Thoughts

### Rust Walkthroughs

### Research

### Miscellaneous

## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [synth](https://github.com/getsynth/synth), a declarative test data generator written in Rust.

[llogiq](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/942) shamelessly used his recent self-suggestion for lack of another nomination.

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Module of the Week

Continuing [Rust Module of the Week](https://motw.rs) this week is [std::fs Part 2: Dirs, Dirs, Dirs](https://motw.rs/blog/2021/08/08/stdfs-part-2-dirs-dirs-dirs/). Contribution and feedback welcome [here](https://github.com/slyons/rust-module-of-the-week).

## Call for Participation

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but didn't know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines].

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A fairly busy week which was to expected given that we've [adjusted our algorithm](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/956) for whether we label a change as a regression or not. Most regressions were relatively small, and only one has not yet been addressed in some way.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [6b2050..aa8f27](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=6b20506d17f4e5e5bf5bcad7e94add4d754b0ae3&end=aa8f27bf4d980023a8b245ceb25a490a18041eb2&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

59 comparisons made in total
3 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2021-08-17.md).

### Approved RFCs

# Quote of the Week

> **Rust** : You can't move your object and try to keep it, too.  
> **Me** : Ok, I suppose I can clone it?  
> **Rust** : Then implement a clone method.  
> **Me** : Why am I getting a stack overflow?  
> **Rust** : It is never a good idea for a clone method to call itself.  
> **Me** : I just wanted to simplify the trivial cases.  
> **Rust** : It is still not a good idea for a clone method to call itself.  
> **Me** : I can't believe I have gotten myself into this.
