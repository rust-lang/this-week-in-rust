### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A mixed week: some minor regressions, but things overall improved for instruction counts.

Max RSS has gone up slightly over the past
[month](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=2022-03-01&end=2022-03-30&kind=percentfromfirst&stat=max-rss),
on the order of 0.5% regression according to benchmark summary. pnkfelix is
following up on that with rustc-perf team on
[zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance/topic/max-rss.20over.202022-03/near/277194155)

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [3ea44938..3e751467](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=3ea44938e21f0de8ae7d4f6399a8a30f97867c70&end=3e7514670db841a7f0d7656f3b13b1c8b2c11599&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

4 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 4 Mixed; 3 of them in rollups
63 comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> All that to say that Rust does precisely this great job at decoupling some of these notions that have been, historically, quite tangled for a while; and for those used to that environment with everything muddied, it can be a bit hard to take a step back and rethink these distinctions that Rust makes.
