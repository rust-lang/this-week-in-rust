## Crate of the Week

<!-- COTW goes here -->

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer
and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a `call-for-testing` label to your RFC along
with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

Let us know if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.
