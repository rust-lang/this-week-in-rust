## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [wild](https://crates.io/crates/wild-linker), a pretty fast linker written in Rust.

Thanks to [Mateusz Miku≈Ça](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1418) for the (sort of self-)suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing

An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

<!-- Calls for Testing go here, use this format:
    * [<RFC Topic>](<RFC URL>)
        * [Tracking Issue](<Tracking Issue URL>)
        * [Testing steps](<Testing Steps URL>)
-->
<!-- or if there are no new or updated RFCs this week, use: -->
<!-- * *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.* -->
<!-- Remember to remove the `call-for-testing` label from the RFC so that the maintainer can signal for testers again, if desired. -->

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> The performance impact of moving to Rust ‚Äì and this is a common theme across everything done when we've moved from C/C++ to Rust ‚Äì we saw a 5 to 15% performance Improvement.
>
> I'll say that one of the ways that you could attack that kind of stat is say well you rewrote it so whenever you rewrite something you're going to improve it and if you'd rewritten it in C or C++ you would have also seen an improvement like that but the fact is we did not intend to get a performance Improvement. This was purely a porting exercise and we saw this now.
>
> And the other aspect of this is that we never see performance regressions either when we're doing our ports [...]
