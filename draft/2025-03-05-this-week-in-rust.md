## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [wild](https://crates.io/crates/wild-linker), a pretty fast linker written in Rust.

Thanks to [Mateusz Mikuła](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1418) for the (sort of self-)suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer
and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a `call-for-testing` label to your RFC along
with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

Let us know if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

# Quote of the Week

> The performance impact of moving to Rust – and this is a common theme across everything done when we've moved from C/C++ to Rust – we saw a 5 to 15% performance Improvement.
>
> I'll say that one of the ways that you could attack that kind of stat is say well you rewrote it so whenever you rewrite something you're going to improve it and if you'd rewritten it in C or C++ you would have also seen an improvement like that but the fact is we did not intend to get a performance Improvement. This was purely a porting exercise and we saw this now.
>
> And the other aspect of this is that we never see performance regressions either when we're doing our ports [...]
