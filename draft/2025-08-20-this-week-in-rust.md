## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [tur](https://github.com/rezigned/tur), a turing machine emulator with text-mode user interface.

Despite a lack of suggestions, llogiq is very pleased with his choice.

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for feature implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your feature to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

<!-- If there are new CfT items this week, use: -->
<!--
  [Repo Name](Repo URL)
    * [<Feature name>](<Feature URL>)
        * [Testing steps](<Testing Steps URL>)
-->
<!-- where `Repo Name` and `Repo URL` are one of:
[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
[Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
[Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
[Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
-->

<!-- For all `Repo Names` with no new CfT items this week: use (removing the repos for which new
     CfT items did appear, of course) -->
<!--
* *No calls for testing were issued this week by
  [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

<!-- Perf results go here -->

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

<!-- Approved RFCs go here, use this format: * [Topic](URL) -->
<!-- or if none were approved this week, use: * *No RFCs were approved this week.* -->
<!-- * []() -->

<!--
### [Approved Major Change Proposals (MCP)](https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/mcp.html)
<!~~ MCPs occur infrequently, so this section is commented out by default. ~~>
<!~~ MCPs which have been approved or rejected this week go here, use this format: * [major change accepted|rejected] [Topic](URL) ~~>
-->

### Final Comment Period

# Quote of the Week

> It's amazing how far const eval has come in #Rust. It wasn't too long ago that even a simple if/else wasn't permitted. Now we're not that far off from having const trait impls and const closures, which will make damn near everything const capable.

â€“ [Jacob Pratt on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@jhpratt@mastodon.social/115052212557381430)

llogiq has looked at all zero suggestions and came up empty, so he just chose this quote instead.
