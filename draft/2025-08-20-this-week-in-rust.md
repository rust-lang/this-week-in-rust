## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [tur](https://github.com/rezigned/tur), a turing machine emulator with text-mode user interface.

Despite a lack of suggestions, llogiq is very pleased with his choice.

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by 
  [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> It's amazing how far const eval has come in #Rust. It wasn't too long ago that even a simple if/else wasn't permitted. Now we're not that far off from having const trait impls and const closures, which will make damn near everything const capable.

– [Jacob Pratt on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@jhpratt@mastodon.social/115052212557381430)

llogiq has looked at all zero suggestions and came up empty, so he just chose this quote instead.
