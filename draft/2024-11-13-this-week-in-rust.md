### Research

### Miscellaneous

## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [struct-split](https://github.com/wdanilo/struct-split), a proc macro to implement partial borrows.

Thanks to [Felix](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1374) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> Netstack3 encompasses 63 crates and 60 developer-years of code. It contains more code than the top ten crates on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) combined. ... For the past eleven months, they have been running the new networking stack on 60 devices, full time. In that time, Liebow-Feeser said, most code would have been expected to show "mountains of bugs". Netstack3 had only three; he attributed that low number to the team's approach of encoding as many important invariants in the type system as possible.

– [Joshua Liebow-Feeser at RustConf, as reported by Daroc Alden on Linux Weekly News](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/995814/17e451bcb3015920/)
