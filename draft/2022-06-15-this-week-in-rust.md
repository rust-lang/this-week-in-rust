### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A mixed week. I suppose it is best to focus on the fact we made some big
improvements to a large number of primary benchmarks, at the cost of some
smaller regressions to a smaller number of primary benchmarks.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [bb55bd44..edab34ab](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=bb55bd449e65e611da928560d948982d73e50027&end=edab34ab2abbafc16a78daedf71dbacd2eb0b7bf&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

|            | mean | max | count |
|:----------:|:----:|:---:|:-----:|
| Regressions ðŸ˜¿ <br /> (primary) | 0.6% | 1.6% | 35    |
| Regressions ðŸ˜¿ <br /> (secondary) | 2.1% | 8.1% | 23    |
| Improvements ðŸŽ‰ <br /> (primary) | -0.8% | -3.5% | 72    |
| Improvements ðŸŽ‰ <br /> (secondary) | -0.8% | -2.9% | 62    |
| All ðŸ˜¿ðŸŽ‰ (primary) | -0.4% | -3.5% | 107   |


4 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 4 of them in rollups
47 artifact comparisons made in total

Full report [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2022-06-14.md).

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC: Add a process_group method to UNIX CommandExt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3228)

### Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)
