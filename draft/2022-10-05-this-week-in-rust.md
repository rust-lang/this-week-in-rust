### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A great week, with 170 primary benchmark scenarios seeing improvement. Every PR
flagged by perf provided at least some wins, and perhaps more impressive: No
rollup PR's were flagged by perf this week! Furthermore, cjgillot fixed an issue
where incremental compilation was being unnecessarily hindered by our span and
lint system. Great work everyone!

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [d9297d22..02cd79af](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=d9297d22ad9edc2b56f0dd8734c1187a0c88be69&end=02cd79afb8080fce8c8ce35533c54d8ecf8f390e&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*
