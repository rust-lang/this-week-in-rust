### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Fairly busy week with some massive performance improvements at the expense of some significant albeit smaller regressions. The main wins came in a long-standing PR from @cjgillot to enable encoding spans in metadata relative to their enclosing item. This causes more work in full compilation which causes some regressions up to 5% but can lead to very large wins in incremental compilation scenarios (up to ~70%). For example, the clap crate compiles 68% faster after a small 1 line change than it did previously.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [b38a6d..b43596](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=b38a6d373cb254697411147c0e49cd2e84864258&end=b435960c4cfd3975651c7051be56d7f5d6c201ab&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range           | count |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:---------------:|:-----:|

### Call for Testing

An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:
