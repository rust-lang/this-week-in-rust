### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Fairly busy week with some massive performance improvements at the expense of some significant albeit smaller regressions. The main wins came in a long-standing PR from @cjgillot to enable encoding spans in metadata relative to their enclosing item. This causes more work in full compilation which causes some regressions up to 5% but can lead to very large wins in incremental compilation scenarios (up to ~70%). For example, the clap crate compiles 68% faster after a small 1 line change than it did previously.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [b38a6d..b43596](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=b38a6d373cb254697411147c0e49cd2e84864258&end=b435960c4cfd3975651c7051be56d7f5d6c201ab&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range           | count |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:---------------:|:-----:|

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

* [disposition: merge] [Only include stable lints in `rustdoc::all` group](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/106316)
* [disposition: merge] [Don't derive Debug for `OnceWith` & `RepeatWith`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104163)
* [disposition: merge] [PhantomData layout guarantees](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104081)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)

* *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.*

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
