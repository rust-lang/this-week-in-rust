# Quote of the Week

> One reason we keep certain things as hard errors rather than lints: it establishes a baseline
> that you can safely assume about other people's code, since it can't be turned off. And as a
> result, that baseline can become part of people's mental model of Rust itself, rather than
> something that might or might not be true in any given codebase.
>
> We have to take care to not use that lightly, because that places work on all users of Rust to
> maintain code to that baseline. But there are cases where we do. We don't allow using one integer
> type where another was expected. We don't allow certain operations outside an unsafe block. ...
>
> I think the standard we should apply is asking whether something is part of the baseline that
> people should be able to assume about all Rust code, and if that's worth the tradeoff of requiring
> that baseline of all Rust users.
