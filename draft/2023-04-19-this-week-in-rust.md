### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A busy two weeks (as last week perf triage was not done). Overall improvements outweigh regressions with an average improvement of -2.6% across a large swath of the test cases. Of particular note was the move to use SipHash-1-3 instead of SipHash-2-4 for StableHasher which improved 184 benchmark tests by an average of 2.3%! 

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [7c96e40..74864f](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=7c96e40da81165beef4f273f44e96eeef5a1bd30&end=74864fa496997a6498e623f0d2019ccb7eb6dad0&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [Update the version of musl used on `*-linux-musl` targets to 1.2.3](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107129)
* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for `debugger_visualizer`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95939)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [new] [Use `actions/deploy-pages` to deploy `mdbook` output](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3419)
* [new] [RFC for associated mathematical constants](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3418)
* [new] [improve `#[may_dangle]` for type parameters](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3417)
* [new] [RFC: Cargo feature descriptions & `rustdoc` configuration](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3416)
* [new] [Traits for lossy conversions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3415)
* [new] [Split may_dangle and make PhantomData less weird](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3414)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* [1.69.0 pre-release testing](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/04/17/1.69.0-prerelease.html)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
