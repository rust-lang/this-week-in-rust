## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [rocket](https://rocket.rs), an opinionated web framework that aims to be really ergonomic while still being fast.

Thanks to [David Mason](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1265) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC: Superseding public/private dependencies](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3516)

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [[style edition 2024] Combine all delimited exprs as last argument](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/114764)

### [Language Reference](https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* *No Language Reference RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

### [Unsafe Code Guidelines](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* *No Unsafe Code Guideline RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [Macro fragment specifiers edition policy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3531)
* [eRFC: Implement function delegation in rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3530)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
