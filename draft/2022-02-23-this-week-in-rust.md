### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Only one outright regression this week. We had some very cool work from cjgillot
to prevent queries from doing expensive clones, by just forcing them all to be
`Copy`! Also, nnethercote's overhaul of interning yielded massive improvements
across many crates. Also, a slew of benchmarks were unexpectedly improved
[quite a lot][] by some changes to way we invoke the linker when building LLVM itself.

[quite a lot]: https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8d163e66211c529465868a22686f46c5956342a4&end=6655109f58b7d0f4cae7e04eab476e389c9b9a0f

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [775e4807..a240ccd8](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=775e480722c7aba6ff4ff3ccec8c1f4639ae7889&end=a240ccd81c74c105b6f5fe84c46f8d36edb7e306&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 4 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups

> I still get excited about programming languages. But these days, it's not so much because of what they let me do, but rather what they don't let me do.
