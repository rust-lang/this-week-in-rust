## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [symbols](https://crates.io/crates/symbols), a utility to quickly create proc-macros to solidify database tables into enums enabling compile time foreign key checks.

Thanks to [Marco Napetti](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1267) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A small number of perf changes that unfortunately led to quite a few perf regressions. A large chunk of those regressions were in rustdoc and were considered acceptable since rustdoc is now doing strictly more work. Some other regressions have already been fixed and will hopefully soon be merged. The last of the regressions are still under investigation, but hopefully they will be resolved soon.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [df0295f0..9358642e](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=df0295f07175acc7325ce3ca4152eb05752af1f2&end=9358642e3b8560eee89e6f40aa996c8394a3db31&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

<!-- Approved RFCs go here, use this format: * [Topic](URL) -->
<!-- or if none were approved this week, use: * *No RFCs were approved this week.* -->
<!-- * []() -->
<!--
### [Approved Major Change Proposals (MCP)](https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/mcp.html)
<!~~ MCPs occur infrequently, so this section is commented out by default. ~~>
<!~~ MCPs which have been approved or rejected this week go here, use this format: * [major change accepted|rejected] [Topic](URL) ~~>
-->
* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> NVIDIA's firmware, Airlie said, comes with a set of include files that, in turn, define structures that change over time. To deal with these changes, the driver is going to need some sort of automated ABI generation; he noted that the developers working on the Apple M1 GPU driver have run into the same problem. This problem could be made easier to tackle, he suggested, if the driver were, like the M1 driver, to be rewritten in Rust.
