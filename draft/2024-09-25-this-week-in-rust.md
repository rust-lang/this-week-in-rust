# Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

### CFP - Projects

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but did not know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

<!-- CFPs go here, use this format: * [project name - title of issue](URL to issue) -->
<!-- * [ - ]() -->
<!-- or if none - *No Calls for participation were submitted this week.* -->

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines] or through a [PR to TWiR](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust) or by reaching out on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/ThisWeekInRust) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@thisweekinrust)!

### CFP - Events

Are you a new or experienced speaker looking for a place to share something cool? This section highlights events that are being planned and are accepting submissions to join their event as a speaker.

<!-- CFPs go here, use this format: * [**event name**](URL to CFP)| Date CFP closes in YYYY-MM-DD | city,state,country | Date of event in YYYY-MM-DD -->
<!-- or if none - *No Calls for papers or presentations were submitted this week.* -->

## Updates from the Rust Project

<!-- Rust updates go here -->

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Not too much happened this week. Most regressions of note were readily justified as removing sources of unpredictable/inconsistent behavior from code-generation. There was one notable improvement, from PR #130561: avoiding redoing a redundant normalization of the param-env ended up improving compile times for 93 primary benchmarks by -1.0% on average.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [170d6cb8..749f80ab](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=170d6cb845c8c3f0dcec5cdd4210df9ecf990244&end=749f80ab051aa0b3724b464130440b0e70a975ac&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
Revision range: [506f22b4..4cadeda9](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=506f22b4663f3e756e1e6a4f66c6309fdc00819c&end=4cadeda932d5c261a9a0b1bbd25c4486e4e0a4c6&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

(there are two revision ranges to manually work around a rustc-perf website issue.)

2 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 7 Mixed; 4 of them in rollups
62 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/44fe248ab62545a5ee7a1cd710451ca16073ea62/triage/2024-09-23.md)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [Mergeable rustdoc cross-crate info](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3662)
