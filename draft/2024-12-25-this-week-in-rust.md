## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [OmniLED](https://github.com/llMBQll/OmniLED), a helper to display things like time or audio volumne on a LED matrix that some peripherials (such as gaming keyboards) have.

Thanks to [llogiq](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1383) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* [CfT: Test out Rustup's `reqwest` backend with `rustls`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3806)
  - [Testing steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3806#issue-2278962476)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

We missed triage last week due to some process issues, so this triage includes two weeks of data. The overall result is positive, due to parser optimizations ([#133793](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/133793)), trait solving optimizations ([#134501](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/134501), [#132325](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/132325)) and bumping the cc crate ([#134505](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/134505)), which [improved the performance](https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs/pull/1279) of C/C++ dependencies of the compiler.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
Revision range: [1b3fb316..0eca4dd3](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=1b3fb316751227d30b1523ed0e3f00d83956d4d0&end=0eca4dd3205a01dba4bd7b7c140ec370aff03440&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
