### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A very busy week with relatively even amounts of regressions and improvements (albeit with improvements outweighing regressions). The largest win was the use of profile-guided optimization (PGO) builds on x86_64 linux builds which brings fairly large improvements in real-world crates. There were 2 regressions that caused fairly large (~3.5%) regressions in real-world crates which need to be investigated.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [33fdb..fe379](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=33fdb797f59421c7bbecaa4588ed5d7a31a9494a&end=fe37929e4cba2c5c21e6805805769630c736bc3d&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

5 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 0 of them in rollups
56 comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> Anyway: the standard library docs say "check the nomicon"  
> then the nomicon says "here is some advice and ultimately we don't know, maybe check UCG"  
> then UCG says "ultimately we don't know it's probably like this but there's no RFC yet"  
> then Ralf says "probably it should be allowed if the layout matches".
