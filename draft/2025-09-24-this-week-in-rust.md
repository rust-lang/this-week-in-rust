## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by
  [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

### CFP - Projects

Always wanted to contribute to open-source projects but did not know where to start?
Every week we highlight some tasks from the Rust community for you to pick and get started!

Some of these tasks may also have mentors available, visit the task page for more information.

<!-- CFPs go here, use this format: * [project name - title of issue](URL to issue) -->
<!-- * [ - ]() -->
<!-- or if none - *No Calls for participation were submitted this week.* -->

If you are a Rust project owner and are looking for contributors, please submit tasks [here][guidelines] or through a [PR to TWiR](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust) or by reaching out on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/ThisWeekInRust) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@thisweekinrust)!

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Moving command-line argument quoting from C++ to Rust ([#146700](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/146700)) resulted in a nice performance
win when dealing with many dependencies and large workspaces. A somewhat costly destination propagation
compiler pass was enabled by default ([#142915](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/142915)), which resulted in some build time regressions,
but should result in improved runtime performance. The rest of changes were small.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
Revision range: [52618eb3..ce4beebe](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=52618eb338609df44978b0ca4451ab7941fd1c7a&end=ce4beebecb77821734079cff47d8af08f9f27f11&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
