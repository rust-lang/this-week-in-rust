## Calls for Testing
An important step for feature implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your feature to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

<!-- If there are new CfT items this week, use: -->
<!--
  [Repo Name](Repo URL)
    * [<Feature name>](<Feature URL>)
        * [Testing steps](<Testing Steps URL>)
-->
<!-- where `Repo Name` and `Repo URL` are one of:
[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
[Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
[Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
[Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
-->

<!-- For all `Repo Names` with no new CfT items this week: use (removing the repos for which new
     CfT items did appear, of course) -->
<!--
* *No calls for testing were issued this week by
  [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.
