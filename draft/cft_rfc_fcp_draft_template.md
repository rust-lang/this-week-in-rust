### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

#### Approved MCPs

*    The MCP (Major Change Proposal) [Integreate Enzyme into nightly rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/611#issuecomment-1506929616) got accepted. The [current prototype](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/rust) will be upgraded and integrated into some future nightly releases. Those releases will have experimental support to vectorize and differentiate (in the calculus sense) Rust code.



### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

Please note I have removed the `call-for-testing` label as this RFC will appear in the **Call for Testing** section of the next issue (#) of TWiR.  Please feel free to re-add the `call-for-testing` label if you would like this RFC to appear again in another issue of TWiR.
