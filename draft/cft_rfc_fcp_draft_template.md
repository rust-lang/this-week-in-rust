### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

<!-- Call for Testing Message (post in GH `issue` and remove `call-for-testing` label) -->
This RFC will appear in the **Call for Testing** section of the next issue (#) of This Week in Rust (TWiR).

I have removed the `call-for-testing` label.  Please feel free to re-add the `call-for-testing` label if you would like this RFC to appear again in another issue of TWiR.
