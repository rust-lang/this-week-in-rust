### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A pretty quiet week for performance. Unfortunately, by far the biggest change was a regression introduced by increasing the minimum libc version for linux-gnu targets. The exact reason for why this happened in this case is unclear, and it's not easy to investigate. Luckily, the average regression introduced by this change was 0.4% which is fairly small, and many of the larger regressions were limited to doc builds.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [792bc5a0..cc4dd6fc](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=792bc5a0102d0973d42183a2b267850bb905236f&end=cc4dd6fc9f1a5c798df269933c7e442b79661a86&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

|            | mean | max | count |
|:----------:|:----:|:---:|:-----:|
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (primary) | 0.5% | 1.4% | 146   |
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (secondary) | 0.8% | 1.6% | 78    |
| Improvements ✅ <br /> (primary) | N/A  | N/A | 0     |
| Improvements ✅ <br /> (secondary) | -2.0% | -4.0% | 9     |
| All ❌✅ (primary) | 0.5% | 1.4% | 146   |

1 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups
42 artifact comparisons made in total

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

* [disposition: merge] [[RFC] Support `.comment` section like GCC/Clang (`!llvm.ident`)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97550)

# Quote of the Week

> Don't come empty-handed to a project saying "this could be rewritten in Rust". It's obnoxious and gives the rust community a bad name.  
> Do start the project on your own, adding Rust to the build system and converting some significant functions, and then ask the project's community for comments.
