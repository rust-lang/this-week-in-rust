### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A pretty quiet week for performance. Unfortunately, by far the biggest change was a regression introduced by increasing the minimum libc version for linux-gnu targets. The exact reason for why this happened in this case is unclear, and it's not easy to investigate. Luckily, the average regression introduced by this change was 0.4% which is fairly small, and many of the larger regressions were limited to doc builds.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [792bc5a0..cc4dd6fc](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=792bc5a0102d0973d42183a2b267850bb905236f&end=cc4dd6fc9f1a5c798df269933c7e442b79661a86&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

|            | mean | max | count |
|:----------:|:----:|:---:|:-----:|
| Regressions ‚ùå <br /> (primary) | 0.5% | 1.4% | 146   |
| Regressions ‚ùå <br /> (secondary) | 0.8% | 1.6% | 78    |
| Improvements ‚úÖ <br /> (primary) | N/A  | N/A | 0     |
| Improvements ‚úÖ <br /> (secondary) | -2.0% | -4.0% | 9     |
| All ‚ùå‚úÖ (primary) | 0.5% | 1.4% | 146   |

1 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups
42 artifact comparisons made in total

### Call for Testing

An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:
