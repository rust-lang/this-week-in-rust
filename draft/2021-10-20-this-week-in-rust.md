### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A relatively quiet week: two smallish regressions, and one largish regression that is isolated to doc builds. A couple of nice small wins as well.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [25ec82..9475e6](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=25ec8273855fde2d72ae877b397e054de5300e10&end=9475e609b8458fff9e444934a6017d2e590642cf&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups
42 comparisons made in total
