### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A light week with few performance changes, apart from one PR that added some
necessary extra work to rustdoc and so we observed a corresponding hit to some
doc benchmarks.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [8a746f4a..b38a6d37](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=8a746f4ac3a489efb724cde813607f3b96c2df7b&end=b38a6d373cb254697411147c0e49cd2e84864258&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for io_error_more](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86442)
* [disposition: merge] [More deriving on packed structs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/104429)
* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for `#![feature(const_socketaddr)]`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82485)
* [disposition: merge] [Add PhantomData marker to Context to make Context !Send and !Sync](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95985)
* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for abstract namespaces in Unix domain sockets](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85410)
* [disposition: merge] [Tracking Issue for const MaybeUninit::as(_mut)_ptr (feature: const_maybe_uninit_as_ptr)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75251)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)

* *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.*

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
