### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Some of the recent noise swings have been appearing again this week, but luckily
less often than before. There were a few actual regressions, but most of them
were localized to a single stress test. On the other hand, there were a few very
nice wins across the board, especially for check and incremental builds, primarily
thanks to [#118824](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/118824) and
[#119265](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/119265).

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
Revision range: [bf9229a2e366b4c311f059014a4aa08af16de5d8..1ab783112ab4e4807304dbd249b39771246013ef](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=bf9229a2e366b4c311f059014a4aa08af16de5d8&end=1ab783112ab4e4807304dbd249b39771246013ef&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [RFC: Allow type inference for const or static](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3546)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> Rust can be rather more verbose than C; there are a lot of invariants that have to be expressed in the code. But that is countered by the need for far less error-handling code; it turns out to be a wash, with the size of the two implementations being about the same.

– [Alice Ryhl at the Linux Plumbers Conference as quoted by Jonathan Corbet, LWN](https://lwn.net/Articles/953116)
