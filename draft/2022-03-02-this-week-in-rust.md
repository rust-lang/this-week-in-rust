### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Only one outright regression this week. We had some very cool work from cjgillot
to prevent queries from doing expensive clones, by just forcing them all to be
`Copy`! Also, nnethercote's overhaul of interning yielded massive improvements
across many crates. Also, a slew of benchmarks were unexpectedly improved
[quite a lot][] by some changes to way we invoke the linker when building LLVM itself.

[quite a lot]: https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=8d163e66211c529465868a22686f46c5956342a4&end=6655109f58b7d0f4cae7e04eab476e389c9b9a0f
