### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A somewhat quiet week with only a few improvements and regressions, but with improvements ever so slightly edging out regressions. The biggest regression was in a rollup which makes investigation difficult though it looks like its in trait resolution which impacts crates that do a lot of that such as diesel. The biggest improvement comes from work done by the performance team (more specifically @nnethercote) to improve `macro_rules` parsing which can lead to sizeable performance gains for crates using the ["token munching"](https://danielkeep.github.io/tlborm/book/pat-incremental-tt-munchers.html) pattern in `macro_rules`.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [3e75146..949b98c](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=3e7514670db841a7f0d7656f3b13b1c8b2c11599&end=949b98cab8a186b98bf87e64374b8d0848c55271&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 1 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups
37 comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> I've seen similar sentiments echoed before, elsewhere. The point it's making is the same one that's argued whenever people say you should learn LISP because it'll make you a better programmer.
>
> There's no such thing as a perfectly intuitive programming language because algorithmic thinking isn't something that comes to us intuitively. That's why the first language is always the hardest.
>
> It's helpful and mind-expanding to learn new paradigms and force yourself out of old cognitive ruts. Thus, from an "improving your ability to solve problems and function as a programmer" perspective, what makes Rust difficult is valuable because it's forcing you to learn to think about problems in new ways.
>
> That's the distinction between necessary complexity and complexity due to ill-considered design. (Similar to how, in video games, there's a difference between genuine difficulty and difficulty caused by something like a crappy control scheme.)
