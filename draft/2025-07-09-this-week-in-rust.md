### Research

### Miscellaneous

## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [flac-coded](https://crates.io/crates/flac-codec), an implementation of (unsurprisingly) the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) file format.

Thanks to [tuffy](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1449) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Busy week. Results are dominated by changes that trade some wins for some losses in small incremental scenarios. We also had a lot of noise and spurious small changes on various PRs. Some regressions come from perf related work where we expect to get some wins back later.

Triage done by **@panstromek**.
Revision range: [ad3b7257..0d11be5a](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=ad3b7257615c28aaf8212a189ec032b8af75de51&end=0d11be5aabe0cd49609fff5fce57c4691a22fe55&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

Note: We switched to a new benchmark machine at the begining of the period. We show summary based on slightly adjusted range [6988a8fe..8df4a58a](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=6988a8fea774a2a20ebebddb7dbf15dd6ef594f9&end=8df4a58ac47b778b093652d6190a6f9d54638774&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au) to avoid misleading comparisons from different machines.

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range           | count |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:---------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (primary)    | 1.1%  | [0.2%, 4.3%]    | 128   |

3 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 11 Mixed; 6 of them in rollups
44 artifact comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> You might be asking: why did you rewrite \[...\] in Rust? And yeah, I don’t really have a good reason. It’s a hobby project. Like gardening, but with more segfaults.

– [Collin Richards on their blog](https://richardscollin.github.io/tmux-rs/)
