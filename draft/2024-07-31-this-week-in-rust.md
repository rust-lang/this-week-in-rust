## Crate of the Week

This week's crates are [static-keys](https://crates.io/crates/static-keys), a nightly-only mechanism to speed up checks of rarely changed features and [bon](https://elastio.github.io/bon/docs/guide/overview), yet another crate to autogenerate builders from functions, methods and structs.

Thanks to [EvianZhang](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1325) and [Veetaha](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1326) for the suggestions!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

There were some notable regressions this week. Some of them are being
addressed via follow-up PRs (such as the change to whitespace
diagnostic reporting), and some via reverts (such as the dead code
analysis that tried to flag pub structs without pub constructors). A
few regressions have not yet been addressed. See report for details.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [9629b90b..7e3a9718](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=9629b90b3f7dd8f5626ec9d3b42556f39f09e214&end=7e3a971870f23c94f7aceb53b490fb37333150ff&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

5 Regressions, 6 Improvements, 6 Mixed; 8 of them in rollups
65 artifact comparisons made in total
