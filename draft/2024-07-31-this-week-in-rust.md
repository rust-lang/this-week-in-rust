## Updates from Rust Community

<!--

Dear community contributors:
Please read README.md for guidance on submissions.
Each submitted link should be of the form:

* [Title of the Linked Page](https://example.com/my_article)

If you don't know which category to use, feel free to submit a PR anyway
and just ask the editors to select the category.

-->

### Official

### Foundation

### Newsletters

### Project/Tooling Updates

* [How to do named function arguments in Rust. Introducing `bon` crate](https://elastio.github.io/bon/blog/how-to-do-named-function-arguments-in-rust)

### Observations/Thoughts

### Rust Walkthroughs

### Research

### Miscellaneous

## Crate of the Week

<!-- COTW goes here -->

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

<!-- Calls for Testing go here, use this format:
    * [<RFC Topic>](<RFC URL>)
        * [Tracking Issue](<Tracking Issue URL>)
        * [Testing steps](<Testing Steps URL>)
-->
<!-- or if there are no new or updated RFCs this week, use: * *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.* -->
<!-- Remember to remove the `call-for-testing` label from the RFC so that the maintainer can signal for testers again, if desired. -->

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers
