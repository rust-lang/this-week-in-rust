### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Much noise in benchmarks this week, which makes it hard to tell what the real
improvements were and what they were due to. A query cache change (PR #107667)
is part of the story. In addition, much improvement was reaped from the change
to *not* deaggregate MIR (PR #107267). Finally, microoptimizing `fold_ty`
(PR #107627) yielded a small improvement to a broad set of benchmarks.

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [a64ef7d0..e4dd9edb](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=a64ef7d07d0411315be85a646586cb85eeb9c136&end=e4dd9edb76a34ecbca539967f9662b8c0cc9c7fb&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* *No RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

* [disposition: merge] [rework min_choice algorithm of member constraints](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105300)
* [disposition: merge] [fix: Unexpected trait bound not satisfied in HRTB and Associated Type](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103695)
* [disposition: merge] [Stabilize feature `cstr_from_bytes_until_nul`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107429)
* [disposition: merge] [rustdoc: remove inconsistently-present sidebar tooltips](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107490)
* [disposition: merge] [Relax ordering rules for `asm!` operands](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105798)

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)

* [new] [`recommended-bin-crates` field in `Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3383)
* [new] [Ref-wrapping](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3382)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.
