## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [heck](https://docs.rs/heck), a `no_std` crate to perform case conversions.

Thanks to [Edoardo Morandi](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1295) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Call for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Even though the summary might not look like it, this was actually a relatively quiet week,
with a few small regressions. The large regression that is also shown in the summary table was
caused by extending the verification of incremental compilation results.
However, this verification is not actually fully enabled by default, so these regressions are mostly
only visible in our benchmarking suite, which enables the verification to achieve more deterministic
benchmarking results. One small regression was also caused by enabling frame pointers for the Rust
standard library, which should improve profiling of Rust programs.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.

# Quote of the Week
