### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Overall, many changes this week, but overall an improvement on multiple benchmarks over
the week from a number of pull requests dedicated to optimizations of certain
patterns. We are still seeing a large number of spurious changes due to
[rustc-perf#1105](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1105), which
has yet to be addressed.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [22c2d9d..1c028783](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=22c2d9ddbf356bcdb718e88ca6ee3665e1e42690&end=1c0287830e0fb3c4007afea2819ba03766da6e9c&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

4 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 9 Mixed; 5 of them in rollups
41 comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> The design of the safe/unsafe split means that there is an asymmetric trust relationship between Safe and Unsafe Rust. Safe Rust inherently has to trust that any Unsafe Rust it touches has been written correctly. On the other hand, Unsafe Rust cannot trust Safe Rust without care.
>
> As an example, Rust has the [`PartialOrd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html) and [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html) traits to differentiate between types which can "just" be compared, and those that provide a "total" ordering (which basically means that comparison behaves reasonably).
>
> [`BTreeMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html) doesn't really make sense for partially-ordered types, and so it requires that its keys implement `Ord` . However, `BTreeMap` has Unsafe Rust code inside of its implementation. Because it would be unacceptable for a sloppy `Ord` implementation (which is Safe to write) to cause Undefined Behavior, the Unsafe code in BTreeMap must be written to be robust against `Ord` implementations which aren't actually total ‚Äî even though that's the whole point of requiring `Ord` .
