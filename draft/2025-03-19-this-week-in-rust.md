## Calls for Testing

An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

<!-- Calls for Testing go here, use this format:
    * [<RFC Topic>](<RFC URL>)
        * [Tracking Issue](<Tracking Issue URL>)
        * [Testing steps](<Testing Steps URL>)
-->
<!-- or if there are no new or updated RFCs this week, use: -->
<!-- * *No New or Updated RFCs were created this week.* -->
<!-- Remember to remove the `call-for-testing` label from the RFC so that the maintainer can signal for testers again, if desired. -->

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

## Call for Participation; projects and speakers

### CFP - Projects

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A relatively busy week with a large amount of regressions in rollups which made investigations more tricky. Luckily overall the week was an improvement due to some medium sized improvements through improving target feature computation and a type systems internals fix.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [9fb94b32..493c38ba](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=9fb94b32df38073bf63d009df77ed10cb1c989d0&end=493c38ba371929579fe136df26eccd9516347c7a&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range           | count |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:---------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (primary)    | 1.7%  | [0.2%, 3.0%]    | 18    |
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (secondary)  | 0.8%  | [0.2%, 2.7%]    | 37    |
| Improvements ✅ <br /> (primary)   | -1.0% | [-10.3%, -0.2%] | 157   |
| Improvements ✅ <br /> (secondary) | -1.7% | [-8.8%, -0.2%]  | 158   |
| All ❌✅ (primary)                 | -0.8% | [-10.3%, 3.0%]  | 175   |


5 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 3 Mixed; 5 of them in rollups
44 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/8148c03b441e9a23b93dab2f2c7124eaf9ff925b/triage/2025-03-18.md).

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

<!-- Approved RFCs go here, use this format: * [Topic](URL) -->
<!-- or if none were approved this week, use: * *No RFCs were approved this week.* -->
<!-- * []() -->

<!--
### [Approved Major Change Proposals (MCP)](https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/mcp.html)
<!~~ MCPs occur infrequently, so this section is commented out by default. ~~>
<!~~ MCPs which have been approved or rejected this week go here, use this format: * [major change accepted|rejected] [Topic](URL) ~~>
-->

### Final Comment Period
