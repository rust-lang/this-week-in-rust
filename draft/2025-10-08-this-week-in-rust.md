## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [tokio-netem](https://crates.io/crates/tokio-netem), a toolbox of Tokio AsyncRead /AsyncWrite adapters to emulate latency, throttling, slicing, termination, forced shutdown, data injection and data corruption.

Thanks to [Viacheslav Biriukov](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1478) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by
  [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Largely a positive week. Big win coming from avoiding unnecessary work for debug log in [#147293](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/147293), and another one for rustdoc from optimized span representation for highlighter [#147189](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/147189). Lots of noisy results otherwise.

Triage done by **@panstromek**.
Revision range: [8d72d3e1..1a3cdd34](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=8d72d3e1e96f58ca10059a6bb6e8aecba4a0e9cd&end=1a3cdd34629306fa67624eaa60d73687e7fcf855&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)
