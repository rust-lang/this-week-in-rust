### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A week with a large amount of changes in rollups, which makes performance triage difficult. The performance team and the infra team are working on finding ways to automate marking PRs as likely a poor choice for rolling up. Otherwise, the week overall saw a ~1% improvement in incremental check builds, with smaller improvements to incremental debug and release builds. A number of benchmarks have been updated in the last few weeks, which has meant a decrease in the automated noise assessment's algorithm performance, but that should settle out to steady state behavior on its own in the next few days.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [949b98ca..4e1927d](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=949b98cab8a186b98bf87e64374b8d0848c55271&end=4e1927db3c399fa34dc71992bd5dbec09f945c3d&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

5 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 7 Mixed; 7 of them in rollups
50 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2022-04-12.md)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [New Rust attribute to support embedding debugger visualizers](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3191)

### Final Comment Period

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

# Quote of the Week

> Relying on the programmer to always read, comprehend, and remember the documentation â€“ and then do everything right, every time â€“ is how we get bugs.
